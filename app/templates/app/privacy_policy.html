        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register, we collect your full name, phone number, email
                address, and a password. We store this to create and manage your account.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Data:</strong> You may upload a profile photo and specify whether you are a “Client” or
                “Collector.”</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Proofs:</strong> When you upload POS or cash receipt images, we store those files (as
                <code>PaymentProof</code> records) to verify your daily contributions.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan Information:</strong> Each month you choose a daily contribution amount (e.g., ₦1,000). We
                store your selected amount and the month/year as a <code>ContributionPlan</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Deposit &amp; Withdrawal Requests:</strong> If you generate a deposit reference or request a
                withdrawal, we store those records (<code>DepositRequest</code> / <code>WithdrawRequest</code>) along
                with timestamps.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We automatically collect certain information when you use the App,
                including IP address, browser type, operating system, pages visited, and timestamps. This helps us
                monitor performance and detect abuse.</li>

            <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> To create, authenticate, and manage your user account so you can
                access the App’s features.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Verification:</strong> To review and approve/reject daily payment proofs, ensure
                accurate tracking of contributions, and compute your refund at month’s end.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Records:</strong> To record Deposit Requests and Withdrawal Requests, generate
                unique references, and notify Collectors when action is required.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To send you in‐App notifications, email confirmations, password resets,
                and occasional reminders (e.g., to upload today’s proof). You can opt out of non‐essential
                communications.</li>
            <li><strong>Security &amp; Fraud Prevention:</strong> To detect and prevent unauthorized access, fraudulent

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Internal Teams &amp; Collectors:</strong> Your payment proofs and requested Deposit/Withdrawal
                References are visible to Collectors (staff) for verification and approval. This is necessary to operate
                the App’s core functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Third‐Party Service Providers:</strong> We may share your data (e.g., email address, payment
                confirmation) with trusted providers who help us run the App—such as hosting, email delivery, or file
                storage services. All third parties are contractually bound to keep your data confidential.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law or in response
                to valid legal requests (court orders, subpoenas) or to protect our rights, users, or the public.</li>
            <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> If you explicitly request us to share your data with a third party
                (for example, your bank or accountant), we will do so only after obtaining your consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregated/Anonymized Data:</strong> We may publish aggregate statistics (e.g., total savings
                collected) that do not identify any specific user.</li>

        <h2>4. Data Security &amp; Retention</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Payment Proof images and profile photos are stored on secure servers. Access
                is restricted only to authorized personnel (Collectors and Admins).</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data transmissions between your device and our servers are encrypted
                via HTTPS (TLS).</li>
            <li><strong>Retention:</strong> We retain your account information, payment proofs, and transaction records
                for as long as your account remains active. If you request account deletion, we will remove your
                personal data and associated payment proofs within 30 days, except where legally required to retain
                certain records (e.g., tax compliance).</li>
            <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> In the unlikely event of a data breach, we will notify you and relevant
                authorities within 72 hours, as required by applicable law, and take steps to mitigate potential harm.

        <h2>5. Cookies &amp; Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We use cookies and similar tracking technologies (e.g., localStorage) to
                maintain your session, remember preferences, and enhance user experience. You can disable cookies in
                your browser, but certain features (like staying logged in) may not work properly.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use basic analytics (e.g., Google Analytics or a self‐hosted solution) to
                understand how users interact with the App. All analytics data is aggregated and anonymized—no
                personally identifiable information is shared.</li>
